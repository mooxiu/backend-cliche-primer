# OOP

### High Cohension, Low Coupling
- [StackOverflow: what does low in coupling and high in cohension mean](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14000762/what-does-low-in-coupling-and-high-in-cohesion-mean)

### IOC: 
IOC is short for *Inverse Of Control*.

- [Wikipedia: Inversion of Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control)

Notice that **Dependency Injection** and **IOC** are closely related conceptions. Here is an important article written by Martin Fowler in 2004:
- [Martin Fowler: Inversion of Control Containers and the Dependency Injection pattern](https://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html) 

For Golang developer like me, IOC seems to be a little bit heavy. However, there are also some IOC frameworks(dependency injection frameworks) like [google/wire](https://github.com/google/wire) and [uber-go/fx](https://github.com/uber-go/fx).
