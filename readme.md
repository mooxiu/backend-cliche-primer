# Backend Interview Cliche Primer

> 小生を面接、首実検の後、不採用という恥辱はご容赦願いたし
> --- 山崎豊子『不毛地帯』

After I failed in some interviews (of course sometimes success), I found that I usually did not fail in coding, or in system design part. I failed in some backend cliche (while you can solve coding and system design problems by thinking, you would be freeze if someone ask you about a fancy concpet that you have never heard about). To not fall over in the same place twice, I decided to summarize some knowledges that might be helpful to know.

To make it as simple as possible, this repository should contain only **Backend** part. And if there are some good answers, I will only do the aggregation job ---- that is to only adding link to the answer.

The existence of this repository is because of [system-design-primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer).
