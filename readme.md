# Backend Interview Cliche Primer

According to my tech interview experiences, the coding part and system design part is not that difficult for me. However, I failed mainly in some backend knowledge cliche part (while you can solve coding and system design problems by thinking, you would be freeze if someone ask you about a fancy concpet that you have never heard about). To not fall over in the same place twice, I decide to summarize some knowledges that might be helpful to know.

To make it as simple as possible, this repository should contain only **Backend** part. As there are already a lot of good answers, articles, videos about those questions, I will only do the aggregation job.

The existence of this repository is an imitation of [system-design-primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer).
