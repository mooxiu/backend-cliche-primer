# Backend Interview Cliché Primer

According to my tech interview experiences, the coding part and system design part are not that difficult for me. However, I failed mainly in some backend knowledge cliche parts (while you can solve coding and system design problems by thinking, you would be frozen if someone asked you about a fancy concept that you have never heard about). To not fall over in the same place twice, I decided to summarize some knowledge that might be helpful to know.

To make it as simple as possible, this repository should contain only the **Backend** part. As there are already a lot of good answers, articles, and videos about those questions, I will only do the aggregation job.

This repository is an imitation of the [system-design-primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer). Salute to [system-design-primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer).
